"<h2>Prevention Prescription</h2>
<p>No definitive means exist to prevent autism. Some reasonable possibilities are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have pregnant women avoid any unnecessary mercury intake. This would involve not eating certain fish and not having dental work done on amalgam fillings while pregnant.</li>
  <li>Encourage mothers to eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and breast-feeding. If bottle-feeding, infants should use the omega-3â€“enriched formulas.</li>
  <li>Consider probiotics during pregnancy and infancy.</li>
  <li>If immunizations are a concern, the family could consider having fewer immunizations at once and separating immunizations when possible.</li>
  <li>Avoid exposure of pregnant mothers and infants to toxic household products of any kind.</li>
  <li>Avoid pesticide exposure wherever possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Therapeutic Review</h2>

<h3>Nutrition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gluten-free, casein-free diet</li>
  <li>Try the Food Intolerance and Elimination Diet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supplements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Omega-3 fatty acids: 15 mg/lb total eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to start</li>
  <li>Follow The Antiinflammatory Diet (link)</li>
  <li>Probiotics: 1 to 10 billion colonies daily (one or two capsules)</li>
  <li>Zinc: 20 to 25 mg daily; be careful of mineral (copper) malabsorption</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mind-Body Therapy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intensive behavioral therapy (Lovaas, applied behavior analysis, Floortime)</li>
  <li>Sensory integration therapy</li>
  <li>Auditory integration therapy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Therapy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speech therapy (for language development)</li>
  <li>Occupational therapy (for manual tasks and motor skill development)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experiential Pearls for Using Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Autism</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use a fairly balanced dose of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid for a total dose of 15 mg/lb.</li>
  <li>Consider products from Nordic Naturals, Carlson Laboratories, or Genova Diagnostics. These manufacturers offer a variety of products, including reasonable-tasting liquids and chewable capsules. However, the chewable capsules can become expensive for older or larger children.</li>
  <li>Start omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, zinc, and probiotics at the same time. This approach may be less scientific, but synergy may exist among some of these products.</li>
