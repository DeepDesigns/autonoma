"<h2>Depression</h2>
<h3>Craig Schneider, MD, and Erica A. Lovett, MD</h3>

<h3>Prevention Prescription</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recommend that patients adhere to a traditional or Mediterranean dietary pattern and limit sugar, caffeine, and alcohol consumption.</li>
  <li>Saffron, a spice with antioxidant properties derived from the flowering plant <i>Crocus sativus</i>, may be effective at reducing symptoms of depression and possibly anxiety when used as a supplement.</li>
  <li>Write an exercise prescription for all patients; tailor the type of exercise to something the patient enjoys, whether aerobic or anaerobic.</li>
  <li>Docosahexaenoic acid is generally more structural (important for brain and retina development), and eicosapentaenoic acid is generally more functional (improves communication across cell membranes).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Therapeutic Review</h3>

<h4>Lifestyle</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Suggest regular practice of aerobic or anaerobic exercises most days of the week.</li>
  <li>Encourage activities that will increase social connection and enhance meaningful relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Nutrition</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate caffeine and simple sugars from the diet.</li>
  <li>Consume a Mediterranean-style or whole foods (low-processed foods) diet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dietary Supplements and Botanicals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vitamins:</strong> Augment conventional antidepressant medication with vitamin B complex and 400 mcg to 1 mg of additional folic acid daily.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>St. John’s Wort:</strong> Take 900 mg daily in three equal doses. Choose a product standardized to a minimum of 2% to 5% hyperforin or 0.3% hypericin. Examples include Kira, Quanterra Emotional Balance, Remotiv, or Movana. If no improvement is seen after 4 to 6 weeks, consider switching to SAMe or a pharmaceutical antidepressant. Concurrent psychotherapy is recommended if this approach is acceptable to the patient.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe):</strong> Start at 200 mg once or twice daily to minimize gastrointestinal side effects, then titrate upward to effect over 1 to 2 weeks. Initial treatment of depression may require 1600 mg daily in two equal doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fish oil:</strong> Take 1 g daily. If this dose is not effective, consider titrating up to 6 g of omega-3 fatty acids. Use caution with doses over 3 g daily due to potential antiplatelet effects. Choose a product tested for pesticides and heavy metal residues, and keep refrigerated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP):</strong> A precursor to serotonin, commercially available 5-HTP is extracted from the plant <i>Griffonia simplicifolia</i>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Homeopathy</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Arum metallicum</i> for severe depression</li>
  <li><i>Ignatia</i> for adjustment disorder</li>
  <li><i>Natrum muriaticum</i> for depression of long duration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phototherapy</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Suggest phototherapy with 30 to 60 minutes of bright, white (full-spectrum, 10,000 Lux) light daily using special bulbs, lamps, or light boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
<p>
  The combination of supportive psychotherapy with antidepressant supplements or pharmacotherapy is generally recommended. Primary care physicians can provide limited psychotherapy at frequent visits to monitor lifestyle modifications, dietary supplements, or drug therapy. Alternatively, referral for cognitive or interpersonal therapy is recommended.
</p>

<h4>Pharmaceuticals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    If no improvement is obtained with lifestyle modification and dietary supplements (or if the patient has severe depression), discontinue the supplements and start a pharmaceutical antidepressant.
  </li>
  <li>
    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed reuptake blockers, or heterocyclic antidepressants should be chosen based on the side effect profile matching the patient’s symptoms. Continue treatment for at least 6 months after improvement and consider full-dosage maintenance for recurrent depression.
  </li>
  <li>
    If only a partial response is observed at 6 weeks, either change the class of antidepressant medication or continue the antidepressant and consider adding lithium carbonate (300 mg three times daily, with serum level monitoring) or liothyronine sodium (Cytomel) at 25 to 50 mcg.
  </li>
</ul>
