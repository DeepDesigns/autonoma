"<h2>Prevention Prescription</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Advise pregnant women to stop smoking and avoid drinking alcohol.</li>
  <li>Advise parents not to smoke around their children and to limit exposure to television and pesticides.</li>
  <li>
    Encourage families to live a healthy lifestyle focusing on the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A whole foods diet that limits intake of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives and foods that cause sensitivity reactions, and that avoids deficiencies of essential omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals</li>
      <li>Daily physical activity, preferably outdoors in natural surroundings</li>
      <li>Adequate sleep</li>
      <li>Effective stress and emotional self-management</li>
      <li>Strength-based communication skills and participation in supportive community networks</li>
      <li>A safe, structured, well-organized environment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Therapeutic Review</h2>

<h3>Accurate Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use standard rating scales such as the Vanderbilt Parent and Teacher Rating Scales to assess ADHD symptoms and response to interventions.</li>
  <li>Rule out medical and neuropsychological conditions that impair attention and self-discipline such as hypothyroidism, vision, hearing, and specific learning deficits. Consider requesting a neuropsychological examination to assess IQ and learning difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Encouraging Healthy Habits in a Healthy Habitat</h3>
<h4>Dietary</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Assess diet and correct nutritional deficiencies with a better diet or dietary supplements.</li>
  <li>Encourage patients to maintain a steady blood glucose level by eating regular meals with foods having a low glycemic index. Foods containing artificial colors, sweeteners, flavors, and preservatives should be avoided, as should foods with a heavy burden of pesticides.</li>
  <li>Instruct patients to avoid dehydration.</li>
  <li>Consider recommending coffee or tea as mild dietary stimulants and monitoring for insomnia and other common side effects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sleep and Activity</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Promote adequate sleep with sleep hygiene.</li>
  <li>Consider melatonin (0.3 to 3 mg an hour before bed) or sedative herbal remedies (a cup of chamomile tea or lavender aromatherapy) as a first-line approach to improving sleep.</li>
  <li>Encourage vigorous daily activity, at least 30 minutes daily of activity vigorous enough to break a sweat or make it difficult to talk and move at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stress Management and Emotional Self-Management Skills</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Assess stress management and emotional self-management skills.</li>
  <li>Counsel families about stress management.</li>
  <li>Consider referral for meditation training, including moving meditation practices such as yoga and tai chi.</li>
  <li>Consider referral for effective counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Social Support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Refer families to support networks of other families such as Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD).</li>
  <li>Encourage positive family communication, focusing on goals rather than problems. Help families view overall long-term goals in terms of short-term achievable objectives. Help families learn to make specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-specific (SMART) plans, including ways to celebrate success.</li>
  <li>Consider referring families for additional parenting and discipline skill development.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Healthy Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Advocate for appropriate testing and learning accommodations at school.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Referral for Additional Professional Assistance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Consider referral to a psychologist for neurofeedback.</li>
  <li>Consider a referral for massage therapy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pharmaceutical Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remember that 65% of people respond to stimulant medication, at least initially.</li>
  <li>Consider recommending an N-of-1 trial of a stimulant medication, comparing a low dose (e.g., 5 mg methylphenidate twice daily) with a middle dose (10 mg twice daily) with placebo for 1 week each.</li>
  <li>If the patient notes improvement, consider switching to a longer-acting medication to reduce the number of pills or doses required daily.</li>
</ul>

<p>Monitor and support families with regular follow-up every 3 to 4 months.</p>"
