"<h2>Therapeutic Review</h2>

<p>The following steps are recommended for initial management of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Remove exacerbating factors:</strong> Review current medications and supplements that could contribute to anxiety (especially botanical supplements such as ephedra and over-the-counter preparations that are stimulants). Supplements that are unnecessary should be discontinued.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Screen for diseases that mimic anxiety:</strong> Screening should be performed for underlying medical conditions that produce anxiety, for instance, hyperthyroidism or a withdrawal syndrome.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improve nutrition:</strong> Nutritional support such as with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (two to three servings of cold water fish per week, or flaxseed oil 2 tablespoons a day or 1000 mg of flaxseed oil in a capsule) is recommended. In addition, caffeine and alcohol consumption should be avoided.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Institute physical activity:</strong> Physical activity (aerobic or anaerobic) at least 5 days out of 7 should be encouraged. To ensure long-term compliance, an activity that is enjoyable to the patient is important. Adherence to a regular exercise regimen and setting realistic short-term goals may need emphasis. Increases in exercise level and intensity should be gradual (see Chapter 88, Writing an Exercise Prescription).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Supplements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vitamin B, included in a vitamin B 100 complex preparation with the addition of folic acid (400 mcg daily) should be considered.</li>
  <li>5-Hydroxytryptophan (150 to 300 mg daily) could be considered as a serotonin-boosting alternative, but close monitoring should be undertaken to screen for eosinophilia myalgia syndrome.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Botanicals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Kava, 50 to 70 mg three times a day (of the purified kava lactones), can be given. Choose a standardized product with either a 30% or a 50% to 55% kava lactone concentration. If no improvement is observed over 4 to 6 weeks, consider valerian or a valerian combination or a pharmaceutical anxiolytic (use for at least 6 weeks before evaluating efficacy).</li>
  <li>Concurrent psychotherapy is highly recommended if this approach is acceptable to the patient.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mind-Body Therapy</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> The combination of psychotherapy in conjunction with supplements, botanicals, or a pharmaceutical anxiolytic or antidepressant is highly recommended, especially in GAD. An integrative therapeutic approach is associated with higher success rates in cases of severe anxiety. Often, psychotherapy can provide the patient with skills for coping with anxiety, as opposed to extinguishing the symptoms. Primary care physicians can monitor lifestyle modification, dietary and supplement interventions, and drug therapy. However, referral to a psychotherapist is advised.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Relaxation training:</strong> Educate the patient in relaxation techniques that will empower them to bring anxiety symptoms under control when needed.
</p>

<h3>Traditional Medical Systems</h3>
<p>
  Use of traditional medicine systems (TMSs) is problematic in that TMSs have historically been used to provide primary care for a variety of medical ailments (including anxiety). As an allopathic physician, I generally designate the use of TMSs as an adjunctive modality. However, for those patients who have strong feelings about the use of singular botanical preparations (mostly as being insufficient for treatment) or whose medical conditions appear mild, I am more than willing to be a medical partner and consider the use of a TMS (e.g., Chinese medicine or Ayurvedic medicine) as a primary therapeutic option, as long as the well-being of the patient is not in jeopardy.
</p>

<h3>Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<p>
  If no improvement is obtained with lifestyle measures, dietary measures, and supplement interventions in conjunction with botanical supplements, use of a pharmaceutical anxiolytic or antidepressant should be considered. Depending on the severity of the anxiety and the degree of lifestyle impairment, I often use a conventional prescriptive option with dietary and lifestyle interventions in combination with complementary therapy (e.g., acupuncture, mind-body therapy) to induce a sense of relaxation before the patient is weaned off the prescriptive treatment (often a couple of months later). Depending on the severity of the disorder, I may introduce a botanical supplement (e.g., kava).
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, different clinical responses will be obtained with the various anxiolytics (and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Optimal management may require a change of medication, depending on the patient's symptoms. For long-term therapy, I refrain from the use of benzodiazepines because tolerance can be problematic. Consider referral to a psychiatrist if the patient remains refractory to treatment, is suicidal or psychotic, or requires psychiatric stabilization in a hospital unit.
