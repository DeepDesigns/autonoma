    <h1>Alzheimer</h1>
    <h2>Dharma Singh Khalsa, MD</h2>
    
    <h3>Warning Signs of Alzheimer Disease</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recent memory loss that affects job skills</li>
        <li>Difficulty performing familiar tasks</li>
        <li>Problems with language</li>
        <li>Disorientation to time and space</li>
        <li>Poor or decreased judgment</li>
        <li>Problems with abstract thinking</li>
        <li>Misplacement of important objects</li>
        <li>Changes in mood or behavior</li>
        <li>Changes in personality</li>
        <li>Loss of initiative</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prevention Prescription</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recommend a low-fat diet (15% to 20%). Most of the fat should be rich in omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
        <li>Encourage stress management. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, prayer, and relaxation help lower cortisol levels, improve memory, and reduce blood pressure.</li>
        <li>Exercise. Physical, mental, and mind-body exercises are essential for a healthy body and mind.</li>
        <li>Consider measuring hormone levels (dehydroepiandrosterone, estrogen, pregnenolone) and replace hormones to keep them at optimal levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Therapeutic Review</h3>
    <h4>Nutrition</h4>
    <p>Recommend a diet containing 15% to 20% fat based on patients' preferences. Include organic fruits, vegetables, and fish or seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon or flaxseed oil.</p>
    
    <h4>Supplements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Vitamin E: 2000 units/day</li>
        <li>Ginkgo biloba: 240 mg/day</li>
        <li>Phosphatidylserine: 100 to 300 mg/day</li>
        <li>Fish oil (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid): 500 to 1000 mg/day</li>
        <li>Huperzine A: 50 to 100 mcg/day</li>
        <li>Vinpocetine: 2.5 to 10 mg/day</li>
        <li>Coenzyme Q10: 100 to 300 mg/day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be aware of the rare possibility of increased clotting time in patients taking maximum doses of ginkgo, vitamin E, and DHA, especially with warfarin and aspirin.</p>

    <h4>Mind-Body Therapy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Control stress: Perform daily morning meditation for at least 12-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Exercise: Physical, mental, and mind-body exercises should be part of the integrative prescription.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Pharmaceuticals</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Deprenyl, 5 mg twice daily, slows progression.</li>
        <li>Rivastigmine is the most effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor available. Start with 2.5 mg twice daily and work up per package insert.</li>
        <li>Memantine is usually started with 5 mg in the morning for 2 weeks and then is often increased to a maximum of 40 mg/day slowly over a 2-week period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not use deprenyl with antidepressant medication because fatal reactions can occur. Deprenyl can be used in conjunction with anticholinesterase drugs.</p>

    <h4>Hormone Replacement Therapy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): 25 to 100 mg/day, depending on blood level</li>
        <li>Pregnenolone: 10 to 100 mg/day</li>
        <li>Melatonin (for sleep): 3 mg/day at bedtime. A proper dose allows a complete night's sleep without morning grogginess.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When using DHEA in men, measure and follow the prostate-specific antigen level. If it is elevated, do not use DHEA. Also, consider using saw palmetto with DHEA.</p>
