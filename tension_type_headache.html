    <h1>Tension Type Headache</h1>
    <h2>John Douglas Mann, MD, and Remy R. Coeytaux, MD, PhD</h2>

    <h3>Important Points to Consider</h3>
    <p>Chronic daily headache is often caused by excessive use of medications, including prescription and over-the-counter analgesics, decongestants, sleep aids, and even caffeine. Integrating nonpharmacologic approaches early in treatment, aimed at eliminating polypharmacy, can help prevent or reverse difficult-to-treat chronic analgesic rebound headache.</p>
    <p>A combination of sleep hygiene and regularization of daily schedules is effective in reducing pain in motivated and compliant patients. The botanicals for sleep described previously for migraine can be equally effective for those with tension-type headache (TTH).</p>
    <p>Patients should be strongly encouraged to reduce consumption of sugar, caffeine, and red meat, along with increasing omega-3 fatty acids to reduce sympathetic nervous system activity and to enhance production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins.</p>
    <p>Detoxification from unneeded drugs is part of effective TTH management. One often overlooked area is dehydration. Poorly hydrated muscles tend to cramp and contract painfully.</p>

    <h3>Prevention Prescription</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Notice physiologic reactions to stressful situations in the home and the workplace, especially muscle contraction in the neck and shoulders, breathing patterns, chest sensations, and gastrointestinal responses such as nausea, pain, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li>Develop a daily relaxation routine that focuses attention on posture and muscles of the head and neck.</li>
        <li>Maintain adequate sleep, regular aerobic exercise, and adequate hydration.</li>
        <li>Modify the diet to ensure regular consumption or supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
        <li>Be alert to conditions that may contribute to, or intensify, muscular head pain, such as sinus or dental infection, jaw clenching, tooth grinding, head thrusting, anxiety, and depression.</li>
        <li>Be checked for hypertension at least twice a year.</li>
        <li>Consult a physician if symptoms of weakness, loss of sensation, poor coordination, difficulty with speech, fever, or syncope occur with TTH.</li>
    </ul>
